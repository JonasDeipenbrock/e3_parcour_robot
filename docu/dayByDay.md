Finding team members

get Lego Box

try 'Hello World' Program on Brick

start basic wheel setup

try the different sensors and motors, read the data and try to control them.

switch to chains because we get a smaller turn radius

get basic program running that allows us to controll both tracks individually and start driving around (only manual control)

start attaching the sensors to the base

start cleaning up the code

# 25.10.2021

Finish major design decisions for robot

Experimented with phone holder

# 08.11.2021

Started writing code
 - Menu
 - Abstraction of Ultrasound Motor, Movement
 - BridgeCrossing, FindAndPush

At home:
 - Abstracted more hardware classes
 - Improve Algorithm selection

# 15.11.2021

Improved follow the line code
Started implementation of gap skipping
Switched from Pilot to own control of motors
Improved rigidity of roboter

# 22.11.2021

Implemented Color detection
Added rolling average to line following and fine tuned configuration value
Added motor stalled check to find and push
Improved construction of roboter further by adding a third wheel per side

# 29.11.2021

Implemented improved Find and Push
Experiments with sensors
Reduced friction on both chains
Fixed stop problem of the roboter
Added some weight at theback of the roboter

# 06.12.2021

Implemented Yolo find Crosses
Hardcoded Bridge cross
Experiment in push and find (didn't Work)
