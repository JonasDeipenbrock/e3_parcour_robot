Finding team members

get Lego Box

try 'Hello World' Program on Brick

start basic wheel setup

try the different sensors and motors, read the data and try to control them.

switch to chains because we get a smaller turn radius

get basic program running that allows us to controll both tracks individually and start driving around (only manual control)

start attaching the sensors to the base

start cleaning up the code
