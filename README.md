This repo holds all the basic code and documentation to the ev3 roboter of group 3 from WS21/22

## Task

Every group had to build a roboter using the [Lego EV3 Brick](https://www.lego.com/de-de/product/ev3-intelligent-brick-45500) and additional parts.

### Parts

The following parts were allowed to be used (but only 4 sensors can be connected at the same time)

-   1 EV3 Brick
-   2 Large motors
-   1 Medium motor
-   2 Bumper sensors
-   1 Ultrasonic sensor
-   1 Color sensor
-   1 Rotation sensor

### Framework

We used [leJOS EV3](https://lejos.sourceforge.io) in the 0.9.0-beta version. This enables us to write Java code for the brick instead of using the usual interface by Lego themselfs.

---

### Installation

To use the code follow the guidelines in the [Lejos Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Home/).
